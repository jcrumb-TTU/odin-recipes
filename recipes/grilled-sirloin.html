        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Top Sirloin steak</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak from fridge to counter top for 10 minutes before cooking. This keeps the steak from under cooking later.</li>
            <li>Place grilling skillet on stove top at medium-high heat with two tablespoons of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Season steak on both sides generously with salt and pepper. Be sure to roll the sides of the steak in the seasoning on the board.</li>
            <li>Once oil is smoking in the pan, place the steak into the pan. Make sure that when you do this, you lay the steak away from you to prevent oil splash.</li>
            <li>Cook on each side for between 5 and 7 minutes. Be sure not to turn over the steak too quickly or there will be no crust on either side.</li>
            <li>When you've flipped your steak, set two tablespoons of unsalted butter into the pan with the steak and baste with a spoon when the butter has melted.</li>
            <li>Once the steak has reached medium rare to medium temperature, remove from the pan and allow to rest for at least half the time spent cooking.</li>
        </ol>
